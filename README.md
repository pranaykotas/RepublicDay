# RepublicDay
## Celebrating Republic Day Appropriately
 
Republic Days in India are often celebrated exactly like Independence Days. So Nitin Pai and Saurabh Chandra decided to do something about it. They made a "toolkit" to honour the day appropriately.  I deployed it earlier this year, and it was quite a success. So I'm open-sourcing it here in the hope that some of you might also change the way the Republic Day is celebrated in your community. 

1. After the flag-hoisting and national anthem, do a reading together of the Preamble of the Constitution. I used the original version.
2. Conduct a short written quiz on the Constitution and the Indian Republic. I'm sharing the quiz questions I used earlier this year. Feel free to modify or reuse it. If you want the answer sheet, DM me.
3. For kids > 10 years old, conduct an essay/poem competition on the importance of the word fraternity.
4. For kids < 10 years old, a drawing competition on the Indian Constitution.
5. Consider books as awards for the winners. The Eastern Book Store's pocketbook Constitution is beautiful and makes a terrific gift. Our book We, the Citizens also makes a good gift for anyone > 10 years old.
6. Please post your experience here in the comments.
